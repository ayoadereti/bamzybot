# bamzybot
A custom implementation of Pircbot for consuming WeatherAPI.com and Merriam-Webster Dictionary APIs

This project is the product of a desire to stretch my capacity as a programmer by exploring and implementing an—at the time of 
its conception—unfamiliar concept. One of my professors this past summer mentioned the importance of APIs in cross-application
communication, specifically in information retrieval, and back-end development generally in passing and planted the seed for me seek 
further information through a tangible undertaking on my own.
